- currently in Vegas so I don't have access to a kitchen scale 
- there was a sale at sprouts on the Red Mill AP for 10lbs for $6 : used that instead of KA 

- yesterday made a standard white. had a good crumb and chewy crust but was slightly flatter than i wanted 
- yesterdays stndard white ws probably the best boule ive made so far / granted ive only made around 5 batches 
- making a poolish bread today with FSWY
- realized that last night at ~7pm put too little dough so I added the extra flour in the mix this morning to keep the percentages right 
    (recipe called for 3.75 - I put in 3.25 cups)
- went to go do some work at Brew Tea tihs morning, so I couldnt keep an ey on it and have been letting it sit in the fridge for ~ 5 hours
- fswy calls for a 3 hour rise. Ill take it out at around 4pm and let rise for two hours at room temp : then proof at 6pm : bake at ~7pm
