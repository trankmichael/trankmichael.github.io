<h1> Biography</h1>

<p>
     I am currently a student at Tufts University.  I am studying Computer Science </br>
and Mathematics.  I grew up in Las Vegas, Nevada and my parents currently live     </br>
there.  I went to high school in Irvine, California and most of my family and      </br>
friends live there. I have one younger sister who is currently a Sophomore at      </br>
Syracuse University.  
</p>
<p>
     When I am away from the computer I like to spend my time outdoors.  I enjoy   </br>
climbing, cycling, swimming, and surfing.  When staying in Vegas, Red Rock National</br>
Park is just a short drive from my parents house.  I sport climb around 5.9/5.10   </br>
and boulder about V3.  Though I do not actually find much time to bike anymore,    </br>
during high school my friends and I completed the century from Irvine to San Diego </br>
a few times.  I swam in high school and I still do regularly as it is an easy way  </br>
to cool off in the summer.  My hobbies mainly depend on where exactly I am staying </br>
at the time and who I happen to be with.
